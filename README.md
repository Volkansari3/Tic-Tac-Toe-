# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game for two players. The game allows players to select markers, flip a coin to determine who goes first, and take turns placing their markers on the board. The game will announce the winner or a draw at the end.

Features:
- Players can choose between 'X' or 'O' as their markers.
- A coin toss determines which player goes first.
- The board is displayed after each turn.
- The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
- Players can choose to play again after a round.

How to Play:
- When the game starts, the players are asked to choose their markers ('X' or 'O').
- A coin flip determines which player will go first.
- Players take turns selecting a position on the 3x3 grid (positions are numbered 1-9).
- The game ends when one player wins or the board is full (resulting in a draw).
- After the game ends, players can choose to play again or quit.
